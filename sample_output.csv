What does DEI stand for? Don Erika Navanka? Not quite. DEI stands for diversity, equity, and inclusion. Diversity, representation of different backgrounds. Equity, fair access and opportunities, and inclusion, creating a welcoming environment where all voices matter. Let's see how DEI benefits your daily life. One example of DEI is the electoral college. This system balances representation by giving smaller populated states a proportionally larger influence on the presidential election. Basically DEI. You now know what DEI means and how it can't cause planes to fall out of the sky.","en"

From the moment we start earning, buying, or even inheriting, taxes are part of our lifetime journey.

Every time we pay taxes, may halong bigat lalo na kung hindi natin naiintindihan saan napupunta ang perang pinaghirapan natin. Pero the truth is… taxes are not meant to burden us. They’re meant to build the country we live in.

So to them, they think that all DI needs is that there's an unqualified woman on unqualified personal color who's given a job or permission promotion and they don't deserve it. When sexuality, all that says is that instead of doing word-of-mouth recruitment, instead of just hiring the usual suspects, we're going to look beyond and find qualified, talented people outside the usual suspects. That's all that means. The people they hired are qualified. It's kind of like, is if you went into a town and they, you never got the contract because you were new to the town and then when they say, you know what, let's let people aren't new to the town have opportunities. And you finally get your big shot and you know your quality of work is better than the people who are in the town who always get the, the, the, the beds and because they decide to look beyond the usual suspects, you get a bit. That's all DI is. There's a minute you're not qualified. It just means someone opened up the door to give you an opportunity and chance. That's all it is. Got it? Good.","en"

In terms of creating the best meritocracy, ensuring that the best person gets chosen to do the job, do you think having DEI is better or worse for that? I think having DEI is better for that because we are making sure to take the time to look at people that might be overlooked based on the system that we have right now.","en"

But I'm going to tell you what DEI practices actually are in how absurd it would be that anybody would be against them. First of all, DEI is not a preference program. All it is is a program to make sure that everybody of similar skill sets has a chance to succeed. So this includes guidance counselors in socio-economically depressed areas. It includes cities but it also includes rural areas. This is to help kids plan their future after high school. That's one of the things. This also includes economic development programs that some universities do in local areas around them to help build them up and help people have a better future. It's also understandings of various religions so that we could all get along better. This seemed kind of like a big deal right now. The majority of it is scholarships so that under-prolvitch kids can go to universities. Again, not a preference. This is for anybody who can't afford it or is from a background where their families and things haven't been able to go to school. So to reiterate, those are just sprinkling of certain things that Trump wants to cut up apparently. DEI is not a preference program. DEI works for everybody including to spell it out crystal clear for you. Many people as well.","en"

What is DEI? DEI typically focuses on ensuring workplace diversity which means representing different backgrounds and identities equitable which means fair opportunities and treatment for everyone and inclusive which means creating an environment where everyone feels valued and respected. I feel like those are pretty basics to have in the workplace everyone wants to feel valued and respected by their employer and their co-workers Okay, what does DEI do in the workplace? It basically covers four different main categories so hiring and retention that means basically just practicing to ensure diversity in the hiring process equitable policies to prevent discrimination bias. This is mostly for a lot of like the predominantly white like straight like super conservative companies that might not have an inclusive work place that's as inviting to people of other backgrounds. Inclusive workplace culture and that's just to help support employee well-being and then training and education which is to promote awareness and allyship for people different backgrounds. Who is affected in DEI? This is really what got me because I didn't realize so many people didn't realize that they were personally affected by DEI women if you're a woman and you voted for Trump good luck sister because work and finding a job is going to be a lot harder now that they're rolling back to EI. You think it it only affects the guys? No no no no no so it affects women people of color anyone in the LGBTQ plus community people with disabilities I'm not talking just physical disabilities I'm talking mental disabilities I'm talking mental health if you struggle with mental health anxiety depression ADHD any of that that also falls under disabilities so you're included in that. Religious minorities if you're not Christian you're included in DEI neurodivergent individuals you're included in DEI well-income individuals you're included in DEI Prigna people you're included in DEI formerly incarcerated individuals you're included in DEI the elderly some of the old people out here voting for Trump like they're not gonna get affected by DEI too if you get fired from your job good luck finding a new one a lot of employers don't typically want to hire the older person because they realize they're going to want to retire sooner than say a 30 year old person So that's why we have laws in place to prevent age discrimination That individual says in this only affects people and Michigan in New York because Michigan in New York has specific laws to help prevent fat phobia in the workplace but that's definitely gotten rolled back there's a lot of different groups that real and can we talk about the fact that the the head of rolling back DEI is a DEI higher so you are in a wheelchair you're the reason you can access the White House literally if DEI wasn't a thing you think there'd be like wheelchair access probably not guys please take some time to educate yourself I can provide my sources I can go more in depth but this video has been four minutes already so I hope this helped you get a little more of a grasp on what DEI is and how it affects people because it affects most people especially these days most people deal with mental health struggles at some capacity and if you've ever had to take a mental health day off of work see ya you won't be having those days anymore unless you work at a company that specifically supports DEI so please everyone go advocate for DEI it is good thing and not about thing it's not taking away jobs from people it's just giving more people opportunities to have it's giving more people the chance to have the same opportunity it's evening the playing field the best metaphor I ever saw for understanding equity in the workplace was there's four people one's in a wheelchair one's really short one's kind of short and one's tall they're all trying to watch a baseball game over the fence the person in the wheelchair needs a ramp the tall person doesn't need anything because they can already see over the fence the medium height person needs maybe one little block to see over the fence the short person needs three blocks to see over the fence needs a little separate that's equity that's what DEI does in the workplace it makes it so everyone has an equal opportunity to make the same advances and to get hired in the first place so if there's three people with the same credentials and you're at an all-white workplace they might go with the minority to help diversify that's a good thing that's giving more opportunities to people that have faced it for a city for so long we're making it equitable it's not about equal because nothing's equal in life people need to stop saying I want equal each or equal to an equal treatment you think life's equal no equitable equitable treatment in the workplace that means it's fair thank you","en"

Even though a DEI doesn't stand for a diverse equity and truth, it's basically new ways to discriminate. No, DEI's to prevent discrimination. How can DEI be preventing discrimination if it's making white men be exquisite? It's helping everybody else but, THAAA! We do understand that 73% of white men own CEO positions. 72% of white men own senior positions in the Fortune 500 gun. Okay, that's them, but I still work at Pizza Hut. You see here in the Fendi, I went as bad for the country. Because where's the discrimination you're talking about? I understand that rich white people rule these sectors, but what about the poor white? Every day white managers. Well 40% of white men own leadership positions in general in the mirror. What I'm saying is like why don't we just hire people based off of what they can do rather than what they look like? Isn't that because that's not what DEI is. DEI is hiring someone for what they're a born-ass rather than the country. No, DEI is to hire qualified individuals that normally would be overlooked because of what they were born-ass. What? Then why was DEI explaining me is the exact opposite? How do you have a different definition? Because a billionaire lied to you and told you it was a race war when it's a class war. Class war, what reason would a billionaire have to lie to you? Black is just trying to keep me confused, angry in the back of the country. Because if a billionaire can keep you distracted long enough to pick your pockets, you're going to be too mad at the next guy that's also broke with you to realize who's actually scamming you with all the time. No, no, no scamming me is Mexico anyway. It's not fair that Black people get DEI will lie to you. Black people make up for 4% of DEI hires. Wait, 4% that's not what they told. Yes, and the white women are the top recipients of DEI. White women are the number one recipients. How come no one ever talks about it? No one talks about Black people when they imagine DEI. What if they get me so soon from that? Because you've been spoiled. You understand that since the DEI has been dismantled, all these rich billionaires are hiring their families, their family friends, not what you're implying that. This is a sampling DEI only benefits rich people. People are people related to REF EBA. I thought DEI was the reason where to buy that. No, because the definition of DEI that billionaires lied and gave to you is the DEI that they're actually using, which is just nepotist. Listen depict complex.

Because DEI programs in the workforce happen to benefit veterans. They benefit people with disabilities. They benefit people at an economic desperate. They benefit lots of people that is not just on the basis of race. And to me, it feels like you're conflating DEI with pro-blackness or black only. So let's not the definition of DEI. So let's take a high profile DEI example. Is that cool? Just maybe one we can play around with, which I got me in a lot of viral trouble, which I don't care, which is pilots. I got in a lot of viral trouble too. Is it beating the sky? I know. And you kept interrupting you. You did. I know, right? Which is this, which is that let's say DEI. A project of DEI at United Airlines was that we want to get 40% of our pilots to be black or women or people of color. 40%. A 50. I'm sorry. I got up to 50. It was at like 6%. So therefore, they wanted to make a push towards that. And it was currently at 6%. We look at that and we say, wow, you're going to have the lower standards to get to that goal. Why would you have to lower standards? Are you saying that black people are in the United States? I'm saying the opposite. I'm saying that a black people are only 13% of the population. So you want 13% of population? Women are not 13% of the population. Women are 50% of the population. Yeah, but women do not make up a majority of people that want to become pilots. In fact, the vast majority of women don't want to be pilots. Maybe they would want to become pilots at the barriers for entry. Well, see that now we're going down a different but equally fun direction, which is male female differences. Men much more likely want to be involved in heavy machinery mechanics. They want to be pilots. They want to be tank operators. They want to be police officers. Whereas women much more likely want to be, you know, I'll get to you, Mason. Don't worry. And I remember your name. Yes. Mason, go. They won't let him go. I'll let you go. I'll let Mason go. But just Mason had some patience. We did this last time. OK. So, but do you understand at least from our perspective? Because it's no good for us to go back and forth again. Maybe from my our perspective that we worry that the pursuit of diversity can mean the compromising of excellence. Charlie Kirk, this country is diverse. You can't just say the pursuit of diversity is compromising excellence. Diversity literally just means difference. This country is 13% black. It's 14% immigrant. It's one fifth of every person in this country is Hispanic. It's 7% homosexual and 50% of the country disagrees with you. Diversity is America. You cannot say all of that is true. Get you our America first. If you do not care about half of America. I care about them so much. In fact, you care about them so much that you don't want to give them. I didn't interrupt you. Access. I care about them. You equal rights. Well, I'm no one said right. So about a second. I know. I care about that. It's equal rights. I am a loop in it. Yes. Let me finish. Now who's interrupting? I care about them so much. I want the only thing that they're ever judged on is to be their character or their competency not their skin. Okay. So you wanted to be a meritocracy. Yes.","en"
